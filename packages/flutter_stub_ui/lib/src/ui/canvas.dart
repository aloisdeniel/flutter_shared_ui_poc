  /// This lets you create composite effects, for example making a group of

  /// entire group can be made transparent using the [saveLayer]'s paint.

  /// Call [restore] to pop the save stack and apply the paint to the group.
  ///
  /// ## Using saveLayer with clips
  ///
  /// When a rectangular clip operation (from [clipRect]) is not axis-aligned
  /// with the raster buffer, or when the clip operation is not rectalinear (e.g.
  /// because it is a rounded rectangle clip created by [clipRRect] or an
  /// arbitrarily complicated path clip created by [clipPath]), the edge of the
  /// clip needs to be anti-aliased.
  ///
  /// If two draw calls overlap at the edge of such a clipped region, without
  /// using [saveLayer], the first drawing will be anti-aliased with the
  /// background first, and then the second will be anti-aliased with the result
  /// of blending the first drawing and the background. On the other hand, if
  /// [saveLayer] is used immediately after establishing the clip, the second
  /// drawing will cover the first in the layer, and thus the second alone will
  /// be anti-aliased with the background when the layer is clipped and
  /// composited (when [restore] is called).
  ///
  /// For example, this [CustomPainter.paint] method paints a clean white
  /// rounded rectangle:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
  ///   Rect rect = Offset.zero & size;
  ///   canvas.save();
  ///   canvas.clipRRect(new RRect.fromRectXY(rect, 100.0, 100.0));
  ///   canvas.saveLayer(rect, new Paint());
  ///   canvas.drawPaint(new Paint()..color = Colors.red);
  ///   canvas.drawPaint(new Paint()..color = Colors.white);
  ///   canvas.restore();
  ///   canvas.restore();
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// On the other hand, this one renders a red outline, the result of the red
  /// paint being anti-aliased with the background at the clip edge, then the
  /// white paint being similarly anti-aliased with the background _including
  /// the clipped red paint_:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
  ///   // (this example renders poorly, prefer the example above)
  ///   Rect rect = Offset.zero & size;
  ///   canvas.save();
  ///   canvas.clipRRect(new RRect.fromRectXY(rect, 100.0, 100.0));
  ///   canvas.drawPaint(new Paint()..color = Colors.red);
  ///   canvas.drawPaint(new Paint()..color = Colors.white);
  ///   canvas.restore();
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// This point is moot if the clip only clips one draw operation. For example,
  /// the following paint method paints a pair of clean white rounded
  /// rectangles, even though the clips are not done on a separate layer:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size) {
  ///   canvas.save();
  ///   canvas.clipRRect(new RRect.fromRectXY(Offset.zero & (size / 2.0), 50.0, 50.0));
  ///   canvas.drawPaint(new Paint()..color = Colors.white);
  ///   canvas.restore();
  ///   canvas.save();
  ///   canvas.clipRRect(new RRect.fromRectXY(size.center(Offset.zero) & (size / 2.0), 50.0, 50.0));
  ///   canvas.drawPaint(new Paint()..color = Colors.white);
  ///   canvas.restore();
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// (Incidentally, rather than using [clipRRect] and [drawPaint] to draw
  /// rounded rectangles like this, prefer the [drawRRect] method. These
  /// examples are using [drawPaint] as a proxy for "complicated draw operations
  /// that will get clipped", to illustrate the point.)
  ///
  /// ## Performance considerations
  ///
  /// Generally speaking, [saveLayer] is relatively expensive.
  ///
  /// There are a several different hardware architectures for GPUs (graphics
  /// processing units, the hardware that handles graphics), but most of them
  /// involve batching commands and reordering them for performance. When layers
  /// are used, they cause the rendering pipeline to have to switch render
  /// target (from one layer to another). Render target switches can flush the
  /// GPU's command buffer, which typically means that optimizations that one
  /// could get with larger batching are lost. Render target switches also
  /// generate a lot of memory churn because the GPU needs to copy out the
  /// current frame buffer contents from the part of memory that's optimized for
  /// writing, and then needs to copy it back in once the previous render target
  /// (layer) is restored.
  ///
  /// See also:
  ///
  ///  * [save], which saves the current state, but does not create a new layer
  ///    for subsequent commands.
  ///  * [BlendMode], which discusses the use of [Paint.blendMode] with
