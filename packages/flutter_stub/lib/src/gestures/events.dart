/// centimeter, or 96 pixels per inch.
///
/// This allows gestures to be recognized independent of the precise hardware
/// characteristics of the device. In particular, features such as touch slop
/// (see [kTouchSlop]) can be defined in terms of roughly physical lengths so
/// that the user can shift their finger by the same distance on a high-density
/// display as on a low-resolution device.
///
/// For similar reasons, pointer events are not affected by any transforms in
/// the rendering layer. This means that deltas may need to be scaled before
/// being applied to movement within the rendering. For example, if a scrolling
/// list is shown scaled by 2x, the pointer deltas will have to be scaled by the
/// inverse amount if the list is to appear to scroll with the user's finger.

///  * [Window.devicePixelRatio], which defines the device's current resolution.
